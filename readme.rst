env
============

*Environment variables for sentient lifeforms.*

It's always been a tad clumsy to access environment variables and combine them
with other strings in Python,
compared to shell languages at least.
For example, look how easy in bash:

.. code:: shell

    ‚èµ echo "Libraries: $PWD/lib"
    Libraries: /usr/local/lib

In Python-land however,
even the new-fangled string interpolation doesn't really help.
Required opposite/escaped quotes and brackets complicate and unfortunately
add to the visual clutter:

.. code:: python

    >>> from os import environ

    >>> print(f'Libraries: {environ["PWD"]}/lib')
    Libraries: /usr/local/lib

    >>> from os.path import join
    >>> join(environ['PWD'], 'lib')
    '/usr/local/lib'


With that in mind, allow me to introduce the ``env`` module.
With it I've tried to whittle complexity down,
primarily through direct attribute access:

.. code:: python

    >>> import env

    >>> print(f'Libraries: {env.PWD}/lib')
    Libraries: /usr/local/lib

    >>> join(env.PWD, 'lib')
    '/usr/local/lib'

But wait, there's more!

Install
---------------

.. code:: shell

    ‚èµ pip3 install --user $PKG_NAME  # TBD

BSD licensed.


Options
-----------

By default the module loads the environment into its namespace,
so no additional mapping instance has to be created or imported.
Unless you want to configure the interface further, of course.
The following options are available to customize:

.. code:: python

    >>> from env import Environment

    >>> env = Environment(environ=os.environ,
                          blankify=False,
                          noneify=True,
                          sensitive=‚Ä¶,
                          writable=False,
                         )

Note that a mapping of your own choosing can be passed as the first argument,
for testing and/or other purposes.

Noneify
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enabled by default,
this one signals missing variables by returning None.
It allows one to easily test for a variable and not have to worry about
catching exceptions.
If the variable is not set,
None will be returned instead:

.. code:: python

    >>> if env.COLORTERM:   # is not None or ''
            pass


Blankify
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Off by default,
this option mimics the behavior of most command-line shells.
Namely if the variable isn't found,
it doesn't complain and returns an empty string instead.
Could be a bug-magnet,
but here if you need it for compatibility.

Blankify takes precedence over Noneify if enabled.
If both ``blankify`` and ``noneify`` are disabled,
you'll get a lovely AttributeError or KeyError on missing keys,
depending on how the variable was accessed.

**Aside:** Get item (bracketed) form also works,
for use in cases where the variable name is in a string,
due to the fact that the module/Environment-instance is still a dictionary
underneath:

.. code:: python

    varname = 'COLORTERM'
    env[varname]


Writable
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the Environment does not allow modifications since such variables
are rarely read after start up.
This setting helps to remind us of that fact,
though the object can be easily be changed to writable by disabling this
option.


Sensitivity üò¢
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables are case-sensitive by default on Unix, not under Windows.

While sensitivity can be disabled to use variable names in lowercase,
be aware that variables and dictionary methods are in the same namespace,
which could potentially be problematic if they are not divided by case.
For this reason, using variable names such as "keys" and "items"
are not a good idea while in insensitive mode.
*shrug*


Entry Objects
----------------

While using ``env`` at the interactive prompt,
you may be surprised that a variable entry is not a simple string but rather
an extended string-like object called an Entry.
This becomes most evident at the prompt because it prints a "representation"
form by default:

.. code:: python

    >>> env.PWD                             # repr
    Entry('PWD', '/usr/local')

No matter however,
as any operation that occurs renders the string value as normal:

.. code:: python

    >>> print(env.PWD)
    /usr/local

The reason behind this custom object is so that variables can offer additional
functionality, such as parsing or converting the value to another type,
which we'll explore below.

Remember the ``env`` module/Environment-instance works as a dictionary,
while entry values are strings,
so their full functionality is available:

.. code:: python

    >>> for key, value in env.items():      # it's a dict
            print(key, value)

    # output‚Ä¶

    >>> env.USER.title()                    # it's a str
    'Fred'

    >>> env.TERM.partition('-')             # a safer split
    ('xterm', '-', '256color')

Parsing & Conversions
-----------------------

Another handy feature is convenient type conversion and parsing of values
from strings,
using additional properties of an Entry object.
For example:

.. code:: python

    >>> env.PI.float
    3.1416

    >>> env.STATUS.int
    5150

    >>> env.DATA.from_json
    {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}


Booleans
~~~~~~~~~~

To interpret boolean-*ish* "``0 1 yes no true false``" string values
case insensitively:

.. code:: python

    >>> env.QT_ACCESSIBILITY
    Entry('QT_ACCESSIBILITY', '1')

    >>> env.QT_ACCESSIBILITY.bool
    True

    >>> env = Environment(readonly=False)
    >>> env.QT_ACCESSIBILITY = '0'          #¬†set to '0'

    >>> env.QT_ACCESSIBILITY.bool
    False

As always, standard tests or ``bool()`` on the entry can be done to check for
standard string "truthiness."


Paths
~~~~~~~~

To split path strings on ``os.pathsep``,
with optional conversion to ``pathlib.Path`` objects,
use one or more of the following:

.. code:: python

    >>> env.XDG_DATA_DIRS.list
    ['/usr/local/share', '/usr/share']

    >>> env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK.path
    Path('/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh')

    >>> env.XDG_DATA_DIRS.path_list
    [Path('/usr/local/share'), Path('/usr/share')]



Compatibility
---------------

*"What's the frequency Kenneth?"*

This ``env`` module/Environment-instance attempts compatibility with KR's
`env <https://github.com/kennethreitz/env>`_
package by implementing its ``prefix`` and ``map`` functions:

.. code:: python

    >>> env.prefix('XDG_')
    {'xdg_config_dirs': '/etc/xdg/xdg-mate:/etc/xdg', ‚Ä¶}

    >>> env.map(username='USER')
    {'username': 'fred'}

The lowercase transform can be disabled by passing another false-like argument.


Tests
---------------

Can be run here:

.. code:: shell

    ‚èµ python3 -m $PKG_NAME -v

Though the module should work under Python2,
several of the tests *don't*,
because Py2 does Unicode differently or
doesn't have the facilities available to handle them (pathlib).
Haven't had the urge to work around that due to declining interest.


Pricing

*"I'd buy THAT for a dollar!" :-D*
